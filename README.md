This project is skills check 7. This project was made for a class project. The main goal of this project was to create a multipage web application with a logo page, 
a home page, and a contact page. The programming languages that I used to make this website were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the major issues I faced while making
this project was making the website blend. I decided to switch to a primary gray, white, and black color palette. I plan on implementing an about page, 
as well as a sign-in page.

NOTE: This application was used to practice using HTML and CSS.

HOW TO USE APPLICATION:

Step 1: Once you open the application, you will see a logo and a Navigation bar. You can go to the home page by either clicking on the logo, or click on the home tab in the navigation page.

Step 2: Once you get to the home page, you can either click on the above links to navigate from page to page, or use the buttons below the page as well.
