This project is skills check 7. This project was made for a class project. The main goal of this project was to create a multipage web application with a logo page, 
a home page, and a contact page. The programming languages that I used to make this website were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the major issues I faced while making
this project was making the website blend. I decided to switch to a primary gray, white, and black color palette. I plan on implementing an about page, 
as well as a sign-in page.
